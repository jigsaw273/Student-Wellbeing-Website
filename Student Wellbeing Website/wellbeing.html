				<p>Being phyically healthly not only improves your body but your mood, performance in and outside of school and can have an affect on our behaviour by boosting our confidence. Being physically healthy makes us feel better about ourselves and gives us more energy. It is important to maintain good physical health to have good mental health. Here are some ways to look after your physical health.</p>

				<p>Sleep regularly. You should aim for at least 7-8 hours each night and even more if you are a teenager. Try to keep a regular sleep schedule since, when deprived of sleep, it makes it that much more difficult to focus and perform at your best in school.</p>

				<ul class = "article-list">
					<li>If you have trouble falling asleep, limit your use of electronics such as computers and phones for an hour before your bedtime. You can also try a nightly relaxation ritual, such as a night time cup of non-caffeinated tea.</li>
					<li>Don’t cram the night before. Studies have shown that cramming instead of sleeping is actually counterproductive. Sleep is so necessary for our bodies to function that if a student sacrifices sleep over studying, they are more likely to perform more poorly the next day.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Take time out of each day to exercise. Exercise has countless mental, physical and psychological benefits and has been proven to make people happier and more able to deal with stress. If you’re not enrolled in a gym class or involved in a sport, try to exercise every day for about 60 minutes. Though you may feel like your schedule is too jam-packed to pay attention to your body, remember that staying fit will make you feel happier while improving your appearance and school performance. Instead of doing traditional exercises like push-ups, try going on walks with friends or participating in physical games and sports, it keeps your mind clear and also gives you a break from the time spent at school doing work.</p>

				<p>Eat a good lunch every day. It's easy to be stressed when you're hungry, so make sure to eat a good lunch, and snack throughout the day if you get hungry. In addition, while pizza and other junk food can taste good, it won't provide you with the nutrients you need to be happy and healthy throughout your day. Opt for a healthy lunch that will keep you going all day - you'll find that this helps reduce your stress levels and has positive effects on your life in general. Eat lunch with friends in order to have fun, relax, and take your mind of the stressful aspects of school in the middle of each day. This can give you a much-needed break that will keep you going through the end of the day.</p>

				<p>Good mental health is an essential part of our overall health and wellbeing. Everyone has mental health, just as we all have physical health. Mental health is best understood as simply our state of mind. Our mental health will change throughout our lives, influenced by many factors. We all go through times of having low energy or being unwell, as well as times where we feel good and function well. Here are some tips to help maintain good mental health.</p>

				<p>Take time out to enjoy personal activities. Being a good student is important, but so is your mental well-being. Even if you’re swamped with school work and extra-curriculars, take some time each week to do things you love such as watching movies, playing video games, or going to nature parks. If you don’t have much free time during the week, try to schedule some during the weekend. Schedule time for your own interests. Extracurricular activities, such as school clubs, sports, or other personal interests, can help keep stress levels down and develop character.</p>

				<p>Make sure you have friends, parents or teachers that you trust and can talk to about any issues you are having. Don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it, refusing to ask for help is counter-productive; you’re more likely to berate yourself when you can’t get past something yourself which only makes things worse. Asking for help is a strength not a weakness.</p>

				<p>Like mentioned above, maintaining good physical health is crucial for having good mental health. Doing things such as, exercising, getting good sleep, and eating a healthly diet are very important to have both good physical and good mental health. </p>

				<p>Talk to your school counselor if you’re dealing with mental health issues. If you’re experiencing any emotions that you don’t know how to deal with, make an appointment with your school’s mental health counselor or a private therapist. These paid professionals can help you better understand how you’re feeling and will teach you a variety of techniques to help you cope with your emotions. High school can be a tough few years, so make sure you are open with your feelings.</p>
