				<h1>Dealing with School</h1>
			</header>

			<div class ="article-text"> <!-- div to encompass all text so that it can be slightly less wide that the website-->

				<p>School is a important part of growing up but can also be difficult to deal with. Homework, the pressure to succeed, and social pressures are just some of the many challenges one has to face in school. Everyone has difficult days but if you prepare properly and take care of yourself, it is possible to deal with school and maybe even enjoy it!</p>

				<h2 class ="article-subtitle">Succeeding as a Student</h2>

				<div class = "paragraph"> <!-- Class to help better space out sub sub sections(paragraphs)-->
					<p><b>Manage your time wisely.</b> School is a great place to improve your time management skills, which will later be fundamental to your career and personal life. Once you learn to budget your time well, you will find that homework and other demands are more manageable and you will even have more free time to pursue your own interests.</p>
					<ul class = "article-list">  
						<li>Get a planner and write down assignment due dates and important events.</li>
					   	<li> Try to have a set schedule, such as planning ahead to do homework in the evenings and other activities at the same time throughout the week. Sticking to a schedule will help you feel like you have your life under control.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class = "paragraph">
					<p><b>Aim for good grades.</b> Homework and grades are undeniably two of the biggest school-caused stressors so doing your best to succeed in these two areas will make your life that much easier.</p>
					<ul class = "article-list">
						<li>Stick to a consistent schedule of doing homework in the same place every day. Prepare a space that is free of distractions so that you can concentrate and complete your work quickly.</li>
					   	<li>If you are struggling in a subject, get a tutor or ask a teacher for help outside of class.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class = "paragraph">
					<p><b>Do your homework.</b> Doing your homework will not only earn you good grades, but it will help you better understand the subject material so you can apply the knowledge to your everyday life. To make sure your assignments get done, schedule in a few hours each night to focus on them.</p>
					<ul class = "article-list">
						<li>Use dead time like bus rides to catch up on assigned reading.</li>
					   	<li>If you get sick, ask a friend to pick up your homework for you. This will keep you from falling behind.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<h2 class ="article-subtitle">Developing Good Relationships</h2>

				<div class = "paragraph">
					<p><b>Become friends with a variety of different people.</b> Everybody has something to contribute to your growth as a person, so try to interact with a lot of different people. Over time, you’ll develop a friend group filled with unique individuals that like you for who you are and add a lot of value to your life.</p>
					<ul class = "article-list">
						<li>Be nice to all the students you meet whether they are older or younger than you, that way you can slowly gain the respect of the entire school.</li>
					   	<li>If you have trouble making friends because you are shy, try to break out of your comfort zone by initiating conversations with people.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class = "paragraph">
					<p><b>Maintain good relations with your teachers.</b> Always be polite and try your best in your classes and you’ll find that most teachers will want to help you succeed.</p>
					<ul class = "article-list">
						<li>If you have any teachers that you feel especially comfortable with or look up to, don’t be afraid to let them know. Having just one teacher as an ally can help you when you are struggling socially or academically.</li>
					   	<li>Don’t be a teacher’s pet. Don’t go out of your way to try to impress teachers or you may just end up alienating yourself.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class = "paragraph">
					<p><b>Join a school club or sports team.</b> Extra-curricular activities are a great way to meet like-minded people and make long-lasting friendships. If you’re already interested in a specific hobby or sport, see if your school has a club or team based around it. Otherwise, simply look over your school’s list of activities and pick something that sounds cool to you. You'll meet more people who are likely candidates for friends if you try this.</p>
				</div>

				<h2 class ="article-subtitle">Peer Pressure and Bullying</h2>

				<div class = "paragraph">
					<p><b>Don’t cave to peer pressure.</b> Peer pressure happens when other people pressure you to do or say certain things in order to fit in. While it’s natural to want to be accepted by others, peer pressure can become a big source of stress when other students pressure you to engage in activities that go against your own beliefs, such as breaking the law or cheating.</p>
					<ul class = "article-list">
						<li>If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation, learn to say no and walk away. It may be hard but you will find that sticking up for yourself gets easier over time.</li>
					   	<li>Seek out a peer group that is open and nonjudgmental.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class = "paragraph">
					<p><b>Minimize the harmful effects of bullying.</b> Bullying (repeated aggressive behavior, including physical, verbal, or relational) is unfortunately all too common in schools but learning to effectively cope with and protect yourself is essential.</p>
					<ul class = "article-list">
						<li>If you are being bullied, don’t blame yourself and try to maintain your inner self-confidence as much as possible. Stay resilient by remembering that bullies often hurt others because they themselves are hurting</li>
					   	<li>Get help. Though nobody wants to be a snitch, if you are worried for your safety, seek a trusted adult and let them know what is happening.</li>
					   	<li>Don’t be a bully yourself. Always treat others with respect and kindness and you will find that, more often than not, those same behaviors will be reciprocated.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div class = "paragraph">
					<p><b>Find friends who support you instead of pushing you down.</b>  When searching for friends, look for people who make you feel good about yourself and do their best to support you. Even if it consists of only 1 or 2 people, having a group of friends you can trust and rely on will make your high school experience far easier. If a friend starts making you feel worthless, don’t be afraid to cut them out of your life. It may be difficult, but it will make you far happier in the long-run.</p>
