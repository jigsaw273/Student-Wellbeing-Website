				<h2>What is Wellbeing?</h2>
				<p>In very broad terms, wellbeing can be described as the quality of a person’s life and is strongly linked to happiness and life satisfaction. It's not just about being healthly physically, but also mentally and emotionally. Wellbeing is as much being healthly on the outside as it is a state of mind. Every aspect of your life is influenced by your state of wellbeing, whether it be school, hobbies or relationships, so it is important to look after yourself. By looking after yourself both physically and mentally, you can improve your wellbeing and quality of life, making you feel happier and healthier overall.</p>
